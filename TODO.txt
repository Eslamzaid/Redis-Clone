            3->parse_response(args, command_type)
                ## This function will take the arguments(2), and the type of the command(*1) and then will implement the actual logic

1.# Add the expier feature to set and get. (DONE)
    1.1: Alter the command parser
    1.2: Alter the arguments and response parser
    1.3: Alter the data structure, when another request of get, 

2.# ADD the TYPE command (DONE)

3.# Add the ability for redis streams, and the XADD command
    1.1: Create an array of keys, each pointing to the start of a "Radix Tree combined with Listpack" Data structure (DONE)
    1.2: Implement the "Radix Tree combined with Listpack" (DONE)
    1.3: Edit the interface + The 'Type' Command (DONE)
    1.4: Add id checking, and proper functionality (DONE)
    1.5: Add automatic sequence generator (DONE)
    1.6: ADD automatic ID generator (DONE)

4.# Add XRANGE command (DONE)
    4.1: Support the - command
    4.2: Support the + command
    


3.# refactor the code, (NEED A LOT OF REFACTORING FOR PERFORMANCE AND READABILITY REASONS),
    so it supports proper error messages, better handling of commands, slicing up my functions into smaller ones.
